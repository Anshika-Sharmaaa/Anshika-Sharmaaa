# 👋 Hello, I'm Anshika Sharma

I'm a technophile with a curious mind and a passion for **building logic and decoding data**. After completing my B.Tech in Information Technology, I’ve been on a mission to turn ideas into impact — through **clean code, smart systems, and meaningful insights**.

💻 I breathe in Java & Python and breathe out real-world projects — from secure banking systems to machine learning models that recognize handwritten digits.  
📊 I believe data has a voice, and I enjoy translating it into stories using Power BI, Excel, and Tableau.  
🧠 I don’t just build projects — I build **purposeful tech** that solves problems, tells a story, or simplifies life.
